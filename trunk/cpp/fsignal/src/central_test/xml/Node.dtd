    An example how to use this DTD from your XML document:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE node SYSTEM "Node.dtd">

<node uniqueID="UNIQUEID_0">
    <name xml:lang="en">bundled_key</name>
    <name xml:lang="pt">bundled_key</name>
    <description xml:lang="en">bundled_key</description>
    <description xml:lang="pt">bundled_key</description>
</node>
-->
<!---   
        You must provide an uniqueID, a name and a description
        of the node. In order to to keep
        the platform internationalized from the beggining, add
        names and descriptions in at least your native language and english...-->
